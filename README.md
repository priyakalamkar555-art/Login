# User Authentication System 
- This Project was built while learning authentication & backend dvelopment.
- To be honest i followed one tutorial and built this project side by side while understanding each concept.
- This does not mean i only copy-paste it, i understant concepts, learning how things work, there are some errors i also tried to fixed it. 
- and finally itd done :) This project is symbol of my learning, my growth, it describe i'm learning while building, 
- Its not big project but its little chunk that i'll use in my big project in future...
  
## What I Learned While Building This Project ?

- Users are created & stored in MongoDB.
- cookie & sessions
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Password hasing using bcrypt
- Basic Error Handling in backend
  
## Tech Stack
  
  - Node.js
  - Expess.js
  - EJS
  - MongoDB & Mongoose
  - bcrypt
  -  JWT
  -  cookie & sessions

 ## Working
  1. Create User (/create route)
  2. Login (/login route)
     
       - Enter the same password used during user creation.
       - if password is Correct -> "Yes! You Can Login"
       - if password Incorrect -> "Something Went Wrong"
         
  4. Logout

     ### This project may look simple, but it helped me understand core backend authentication concepts, which i'll apply in more advanced projects in future :)
