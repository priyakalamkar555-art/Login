- Users are created & stored in MongoDB.
- cookie & sessions
- JWT
- bcrypt
- Error Handling
  
## Tech Stack
  
  - Node.js

  - EJS
  - MongoDB / Mongoose
  - bcrypt, JWT, cookie / sessions

    ## Working
    1. Create User (/create route)
    2. Login (/login route)
       - Enter password that you used during creation of user.
       - if password is Correct you'll see one message on browser : "Yes! You Can Login"
       - else : "Something Went Wrong"
    3. Logout
